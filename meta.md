## [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)
```
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity:O(log(x)). There are roughlylog10â€‹(x)digits inx.
    Space Complexity:O(1).

```

```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int rev = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            int pop = x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            if (
                rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && pop > 7)
            ) return 0;
            if (
                rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && pop < -8)
            ) return 0;
            rev = rev * 10 + pop;
        }
        return rev;
    }
}

```

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode res = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode dummy = res;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            head = head.next;
        }

        while (head != null) {
            head = head.next;
            dummy = dummy.next;
        }

        dummy.next = dummy.next.next;

        return res.next;
    }
}
```

## [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

```
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.


    Time complexity: O(m+n)
    m is length of list1 and n is length of list2

    Space complexity: O(1)

```

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode cur = dummy;

        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val > list2.val) {
                cur.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            } else {
                cur.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }

        cur.next = (list1 != null) ? list1 : list2;

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## Merge k Sorted Lists
* https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/

```
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.



Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []



Constraints:

    k == lists.length
    0 <= k <= 104
    0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
    -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
    lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
    The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.


    Time Complexity: O(N log k)
        ( N ): Total number of nodes across all lists.
        ( log k ): Number of levels in the divide-and-conquer recursion tree.
    Space Complexity: O(log k) due to recursive function calls.


```

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null) return l2;
        if (l2 == null) return l1;

        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
            return l1;
        } else {
            l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
            return l2;
        }
    }

    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if (lists.length == 0) return null;
        return divideAndConquer(lists, 0, lists.length - 1);
    }

    private ListNode divideAndConquer(ListNode[] lists, int left, int right) {
        if (left == right) return lists[left];

        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        ListNode l1 = divideAndConquer(lists, left, mid);
        ListNode l2 = divideAndConquer(lists, mid + 1, right);
        return mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);
    }
}
```

## [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
    nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(1)
```

```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int j = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```

## [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

```
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100


```

```
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int ind1=-1;
        int ind2=-1;
        // step 1 find breaking point 
        for(int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]){
                ind1=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        // if there is no breaking  point 
        if(ind1==-1){
            reverse(nums,0);
        }
        
        else{
            // step 2 find next greater element and swap with ind2
            for(int i=nums.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                if(nums[i]>nums[ind1]){
                    ind2=i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            swap(nums,ind1,ind2);
            // step 3 reverse the rest right half
            reverse(nums,ind1+1);
        }
    }
    void swap(int[] nums,int i,int j){
        int temp=nums[i];
        nums[i]=nums[j];
        nums[j]=temp;
    }
    void reverse(int[] nums,int start){
        int i=start;
        int j=nums.length-1;
        while(i<j){
            swap(nums,i,j);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```
