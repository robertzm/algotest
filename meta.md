## [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)
```
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity:O(log(x)). There are roughlylog10â€‹(x)digits inx.
    Space Complexity:O(1).

```

```
class Solution {

            int pop = x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            if (
                rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && pop > 7)
            ) return 0;
            if (
                rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && pop < -8)
            ) return 0;
            rev = rev * 10 + pop;
        }
        return rev;
    }

```
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.



Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,

  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Constraints:

    k == lists.length
    0 <= k <= 104
    0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
    -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
    lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
    The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.


    Time Complexity: O(N log k)
        ( N ): Total number of nodes across all lists.
        ( log k ): Number of levels in the divide-and-conquer recursion tree.
    Space Complexity: O(log k) due to recursive function calls.


```

```

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null) return l2;
        if (l2 == null) return l1;

        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
            return l1;
        } else {
            l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
            return l2;

        if (lists.length == 0) return null;
        return divideAndConquer(lists, 0, lists.length - 1);
    }

    private ListNode divideAndConquer(ListNode[] lists, int left, int right) {
        if (left == right) return lists[left];

        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        ListNode l1 = divideAndConquer(lists, left, mid);
        ListNode l2 = divideAndConquer(lists, mid + 1, right);
        return mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);
    }

## [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
    nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(1)
```

```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int j = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```

## [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

```
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100


```

```
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int ind1=-1;
        int ind2=-1;
        // step 1 find breaking point
        for(int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]){
                ind1=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        // if there is no breaking  point
        if(ind1==-1){
            reverse(nums,0);
        }

        else{
            // step 2 find next greater element and swap with ind2
            for(int i=nums.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                if(nums[i]>nums[ind1]){
                    ind2=i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            swap(nums,ind1,ind2);
            // step 3 reverse the rest right half
            reverse(nums,ind1+1);
        }
    }
    void swap(int[] nums,int i,int j){
        int temp=nums[i];
        nums[i]=nums[j];
        nums[j]=temp;
    }
    void reverse(int[] nums,int start){
        int i=start;
        int j=nums.length-1;
        while(i<j){
            swap(nums,i,j);
            i++;

        result[0] = left;
        result[1] = right;
        return result;
    }

    private int binarySearch(int[] nums, int target, boolean isSearchingLeft) {
        int left = 0;

            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {

## [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/)

```
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the

of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.



Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1

## [Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

```
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.



Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

    0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

    Time complexity : O(nlogn)
    Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O(nlogn) complexity of sorting.
    Space complexity : O(logN) (or O(n))
    If we can sort intervals in place, we do not need more than constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes O(logn) space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of intervals and sort that.

```

```
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        LinkedList<int[]> merged = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
            if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.add(interval);
            }
            // otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            // intervals.
            else {
                merged.getLast()[1] = Math.max(
                    merged.getLast()[1],
                    interval[1]
                );
            }
        }
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }
}

## [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/)

```
The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 9
    1 <= k <= n!

    O(n)

```

```
public class Solution {
public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
    int pos = 0;
    List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
    int[] factorial = new int[n+1];
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    
    // create an array of factorial lookup
    int sum = 1;
    factorial[0] = 1;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        sum *= i;
        factorial[i] = sum;
    }
    // factorial[] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, ... n!}
    
    // create a list of numbers to get indices
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        numbers.add(i);
    }
    // numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    
    k--;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        int index = k/factorial[n-i];
        sb.append(String.valueOf(numbers.get(index)));
        numbers.remove(index);
        k-=index*factorial[n-i];
    }
    
    return String.valueOf(sb);
}
```

## [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

```
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down



    Time Complexity: The algorithm processes each cell in the grid once, resulting in O(m Ã— n).
    Space Complexity: Only two rows are maintained at any time, so space usage is O(n).

```

```
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] aboveRow = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(aboveRow, 1);

        for (int row = 1; row < m; row++) {
            int[] currentRow = new int[n];
            Arrays.fill(currentRow, 1);
            for (int col = 1; col < n; col++) {
                currentRow[col] = currentRow[col - 1] + aboveRow[col];
            }
            aboveRow = currentRow;
        }

        return aboveRow[n - 1];        
    }
}
```

## [65. Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/description/)

```
For example, all the following are valid numbers: "2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789", while the following are not valid numbers: "abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53".

Formally, a valid number is defined using one of the following definitions:

    An integer number followed by an optional exponent.
    A decimal number followed by an optional exponent.

An integer number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by digits.

A decimal number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by one of the following definitions:

    Digits followed by a dot '.'.
    Digits followed by a dot '.' followed by digits.
    A dot '.' followed by digits.

An exponent is defined with an exponent notation 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer number.

The digits are defined as one or more digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "0"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "e"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = "."

Output: false

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 20
    s consists of only English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), plus '+', minus '-', or dot '.'.

```

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isNumber(String s) {
        boolean isdot = false, ise = false, nums = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) nums = true;
            else if (c == '+' || c == '-') {
                if (i > 0 && s.charAt(i - 1) != 'e' && s.charAt(i - 1) != 'E') return false;
            } 
            else if (c == 'e' || c == 'E') {
                if (ise || !nums) return false;
                ise = true;
                nums = false;
            } 
            else if (c == '.') {
                if (isdot || ise) return false;
                isdot = true;
            } 
            else return false;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```

## [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)

```
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

    A single period '.' represents the current directory.
    A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
    Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
    Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

    The path must start with a single slash '/'.
    Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
    The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
    The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the simplified canonical path.

 

Example 1:

Input: path = "/home/"

Output: "/home"

Explanation:

The trailing slash should be removed.

Example 2:

Input: path = "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"

Explanation:

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

Example 3:

Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

Explanation:

A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

Example 4:

Input: path = "/../"

Output: "/"

Explanation:

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

Example 5:

Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

Output: "/.../b/d"

Explanation:

"..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= path.length <= 3000
    path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
    path is a valid absolute Unix path.


```

```
class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        String[] components = path.split("/");
        Stack<String> st = new Stack<>();

        for (String comp : components) {
            if (comp.equals("") || comp.equals(".")) {
                continue;
            }

            if (comp.equals("..")) {
                if (!st.isEmpty()) {
                    st.pop();
                }
            } else {
                st.push(comp);
            }
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!st.isEmpty()) {
            sb.insert(0, "/" + st.pop());
        }

        return sb.length() == 0 ? "/" : sb.toString();        
    }
}
```

## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

```
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window

of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

 

Constraints:

    m == s.length
    n == t.length
    1 <= m, n <= 105
    s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
