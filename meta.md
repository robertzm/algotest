## [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)
```
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:

    -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity:O(log(x)). There are roughlylog10â€‹(x)digits inx.
    Space Complexity:O(1).

```

```
class Solution {

            int pop = x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            if (
                rev > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && pop > 7)
            ) return 0;
            if (
                rev < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 ||
                (rev == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && pop < -8)
            ) return 0;
            rev = rev * 10 + pop;
        }
        return rev;
    }

```
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.



Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,

  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Constraints:

    k == lists.length
    0 <= k <= 104
    0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
    -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
    lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
    The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.


    Time Complexity: O(N log k)
        ( N ): Total number of nodes across all lists.
        ( log k ): Number of levels in the divide-and-conquer recursion tree.
    Space Complexity: O(log k) due to recursive function calls.


```

```

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null) return l2;
        if (l2 == null) return l1;

        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
            return l1;
        } else {
            l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);

        return divideAndConquer(lists, 0, lists.length - 1);
    }

    private ListNode divideAndConquer(ListNode[] lists, int left, int right) {
        if (left == right) return lists[left];

        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        ListNode l1 = divideAndConquer(lists, left, mid);
        ListNode l2 = divideAndConquer(lists, mid + 1, right);
        return mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);
    }

## [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
    nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(1)
```

```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int j = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```

## [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

```
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100


```

```
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int ind1=-1;
        int ind2=-1;
        // step 1 find breaking point
        for(int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]){
                ind1=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        // if there is no breaking  point
        if(ind1==-1){
            reverse(nums,0);
        }

        else{
            // step 2 find next greater element and swap with ind2
            for(int i=nums.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                if(nums[i]>nums[ind1]){
                    ind2=i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            swap(nums,ind1,ind2);
            // step 3 reverse the rest right half
            reverse(nums,ind1+1);
        }
    }
    void swap(int[] nums,int i,int j){
        int temp=nums[i];
        nums[i]=nums[j];
        nums[j]=temp;
    }
    void reverse(int[] nums,int start){
        int i=start;
        int j=nums.length-1;
        while(i<j){
            swap(nums,i,j);
            i++;

        result[0] = left;
        result[1] = right;
        return result;
    }

    private int binarySearch(int[] nums, int target, boolean isSearchingLeft) {
        int left = 0;

            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {

## [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/)

```
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the

of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.



Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1

## [Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

```
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.



Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

    0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

    Time complexity : O(nlogn)
    Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O(nlogn) complexity of sorting.
    Space complexity : O(logN) (or O(n))
    If we can sort intervals in place, we do not need more than constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes O(logn) space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of intervals and sort that.

```

```
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {

            // if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
            if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.getLast()[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.add(interval);
            }
            // otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            // intervals.

## [60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/)

```
The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.



Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"



Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 9
    1 <= k <= n!

    O(n)

```

```
public class Solution {
public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
    int pos = 0;
    List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
    int[] factorial = new int[n+1];
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    // create an array of factorial lookup
    int sum = 1;
    factorial[0] = 1;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        sum *= i;
        factorial[i] = sum;
    }
    // factorial[] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, ... n!}

    // create a list of numbers to get indices
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        numbers.add(i);
    }
    // numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

    k--;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        int index = k/factorial[n-i];
        sb.append(String.valueOf(numbers.get(index)));

## [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

```
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down



    Time Complexity: The algorithm processes each cell in the grid once, resulting in O(m Ã— n).
    Space Complexity: Only two rows are maintained at any time, so space usage is O(n).

```

```
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] aboveRow = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(aboveRow, 1);

        for (int row = 1; row < m; row++) {
            int[] currentRow = new int[n];
            Arrays.fill(currentRow, 1);
            for (int col = 1; col < n; col++) {
                currentRow[col] = currentRow[col - 1] + aboveRow[col];
            }

For example, all the following are valid numbers: "2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789", while the following are not valid numbers: "abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53".

Formally, a valid number is defined using one of the following definitions:

    An integer number followed by an optional exponent.
    A decimal number followed by an optional exponent.

An integer number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by digits.

A decimal number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by one of the following definitions:

    Digits followed by a dot '.'.
    Digits followed by a dot '.' followed by digits.
    A dot '.' followed by digits.

An exponent is defined with an exponent notation 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer number.

The digits are defined as one or more digits.



Example 1:

Input: s = "0"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "e"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = "."

Output: false

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 20

## [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/)

```
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

    A single period '.' represents the current directory.
    A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
    Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
    Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

    The path must start with a single slash '/'.
    Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
    The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
    The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the simplified canonical path.



Example 1:

Input: path = "/home/"

Output: "/home"

Explanation:

The trailing slash should be removed.

Example 2:

Input: path = "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"

Explanation:

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

Example 3:

Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

Explanation:

A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

Example 4:

Input: path = "/../"

Output: "/"

Explanation:

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

Example 5:

Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

Output: "/.../b/d"

Explanation:

"..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.



Constraints:

    1 <= path.length <= 3000
    path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
    path is a valid absolute Unix path.


```

```
class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {

## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

```
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window

of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.



Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.



Constraints:

    m == s.length
    n == t.length
    1 <= m, n <= 105
    s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/)

```
Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.



Example 1:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"

## [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

```
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.



Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.



Constraints:

    nums1.length == m + n
    nums2.length == n
    0 <= m, n <= 200
    1 <= m + n <= 200
    -109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109

## [116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

```
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.



Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []



Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].
    -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.



Example 1:

Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).

Example 2:

## [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

```
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.



Constraints:

    1 <= prices.length <= 105
    0 <= prices[i] <= 104


    Time complexity: O(n)

    Space complexity: O(1)

```

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buyPrice = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (buyPrice > prices[i]) {
                buyPrice = prices[i];
            }

            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - buyPrice);
        }

        return profit;
    }
}
```

## [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)

```
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.



Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
    s consists only of printable ASCII characters.


    Time complexity:
    The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because, in the worst case, all characters in the string need to be checked once, so the number of operations is proportional to the length of the string.

    Space complexity:
    The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as no additional data structures are used, and only a constant amount of memory is required for the start and last pointers and a few variables.

```

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
        	return true;
        }
        int start = 0;
        int last = s.length() - 1;
        while(start <= last) {
        	char currFirst = s.charAt(start);
        	char currLast = s.charAt(last);
        	if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(currFirst )) {
        		start++;
        	} else if(!Character.isLetterOrDigit(currLast)) {
        		last--;
        	} else {
        		if (Character.toLowerCase(currFirst) != Character.toLowerCase(currLast)) {
        			return false;
        		}
        		start++;
        		last--;
        	}
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

```
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

    Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
    Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
    sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.



Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.



Constraints:

    1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
    endWord.length == beginWord.length
    1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
    wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
    beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
    beginWord != endWord
    All the words in wordList are unique.



    Time Complexity :- BigO(M^2 * N), where M is size of dequeued word & N is size of our word list

    Space Complexity :- BigO(M * N) where M is no. of character that we had in our string & N is the size of our wordList.


```

```
class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(wordList);

                    for(int k = 'a'; k <= 'z'; k++){
                        char arr[] = word.toCharArray();
                        arr[j] = (char) k;

                        String str = new String(arr);

## [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/description/)

```
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

    For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:

Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
    0 <= Node.val <= 9
    The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.



    Time complexity: O(n)
    n is number of nodes in the input tree

    Space complexity: O(h) or O(n)
    h is height of the input tree


```

```
class Solution {
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int pathSum) {
        if (node == null)
            return 0;
        
        pathSum = pathSum * 10 + node.val;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null)
            return pathSum;
        
        return dfs(node.left, pathSum) + dfs(node.right, pathSum);
    }
}
```

## [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

```
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:

Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

Example 3:

Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
    1 <= Node.val <= 100
    Node.val is unique for each node.
    There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
    The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.



    Time complexity:
    O(V + E) - This cannot be reduced in any way because we MUST visit each vertex and edge at least once

    Space complexity:
    O(V) - for storing the HashMap and Queue


```

```
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        if (node.neighbors.isEmpty()) return new Node(node.val);

        HashMap<Node, Node> cp = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Node> qu = new LinkedList<>();

        cp.put(node, new Node(node.val));
        qu.offer(node);

        while(!qu.isEmpty()) {
            Node curr = qu.poll();
            for(Node nei: curr.neighbors) {
                if(!cp.containsKey(nei)) {
                    cp.put(nei, new Node(nei.val));
                    qu.add(nei);
                }
                cp.get(curr).neighbors.add(cp.get(nei));
            }
        }
        return cp.get(node);
    }
}
```

## [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

```
A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

    val: an integer representing Node.val
    random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:

Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Example 3:

Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

 

Constraints:

    0 <= n <= 1000
    -104 <= Node.val <= 104
    Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.


    Time Complexity: O(n) â€” Each node is visited multiple times but it's still linear time.
    Space Complexity: O(1) â€” No additional memory is used for mapping; we only allocate nodes for the new list.


```

```
public class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        HashMap<Node, Node> oldToNew = new HashMap<>();
        
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            oldToNew.put(curr, new Node(curr.val));
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            oldToNew.get(curr).next = oldToNew.get(curr.next);
            oldToNew.get(curr).random = oldToNew.get(curr.random);
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        return oldToNew.get(head);
    }
}

## [140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/)

```
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 20
    1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
    1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10
    s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
    All the strings of wordDict are unique.
    Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 105.

## [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)

```
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the LRUCache class:

    LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
    int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
    void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

 

Constraints:

    1 <= capacity <= 3000

## [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)

```
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
    nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.


```

```
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        
		if(nums.length == 1) return 0; // single element
        
        int n = nums.length;
        
		// check if 0th/n-1th index is the peak element
        if(nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0;
        if(nums[n-1] > nums[n-2]) return n-1;
		
		// search in the remaining array
        int start = 1;
        int end = n-2;
        
        while(start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]) end = mid - 1;
            else if(nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]) start = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1; // dummy return statement
    }
}

## [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

```
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:

    Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
    In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

Example 2:

Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.

 

Constraints:

    The input must be a binary string of length 32

 

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?


    Time complexity: O(1)

    Space complexity: O(1)


```

```
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            ans <<= 1;
            ans |= (n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

## [199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/description/)

```
Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]

Output: [1,3,4]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5]

Output: [1,3,4,5]

Explanation:

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,null,3]

Output: [1,3]

Example 4:

Input: root = []

Output: []

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100


    Time Complexity: O(n)
        Every node is visited once.
    Space Complexity:
        BFS: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree.
        DFS: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (for recursion stack).

```

```
public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res= new ArrayList<>();
        if(root==null) return res;
        Queue<TreeNode> q= new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root);

                size--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

```
public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        rightView(root, result, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    public void rightView(TreeNode curr, List<Integer> result, int currDepth){
        if(curr == null){
            return;
        }
        if(currDepth == result.size()){
            result.add(curr.val);
        }
        
        rightView(curr.right, result, currDepth + 1);
        rightView(curr.left, result, currDepth + 1);

## [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

```
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
